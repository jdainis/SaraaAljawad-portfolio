My academic background in medical imaging (MRI) and data analysis, with a strong interest in applying computational methods to biomedical data.\nMy current research focuses on NMR metabolomics, where I study signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), solvent effects, and reproducibility in high-salinity biological samples such as urine. I am particularly interested in building reproducible analysis pipelines and using statistical and machine learning methods to better interpret complex experimental data.\nI have experience with:\n-MATLAB.\n-Python.\nThrough this course, I hope to strengthen my skills in applied data analysis, improve my ability to design reproducible workflows, and gain more confidence in organizing and communicating complex analyses clearly."
